# Learn
A collection of all my learnings.

### What is this repository?
> Almost all the information present in this repository is **not** written by me.

This repository is a collection of excerpts from the native documentations of the technologies, because obviously it wouldn't make sense reinventing the wheel as the native documentation from the creators is the best starting place to grasp a concept.

### So again, What is this repository?
This repository would be a good place for beginners who're staring to learn a new technology and are looking for a place that could give them an overview of the whole picture in a concise and organized manner.
According to me, using a question and answer format might save the day!

> So, this repository is a collection of information on topics in a crisp and organized format that might be intuitive for some users.

Happy reading!
